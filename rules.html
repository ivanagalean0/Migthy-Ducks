                                    assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board 
                                    whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams 
                                    from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable 
                                    field may be required to play all their games away.
